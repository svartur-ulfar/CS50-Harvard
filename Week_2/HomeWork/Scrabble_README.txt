In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is 
the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.
For example: A = 1; B = 3; C = 3; etc. (See the points for each letter in
Scrabble game).
For example, if we wanted to score the word “CODE”, we would note that the 
‘C’ is worth 3 points, the ‘O’ is worth 1 point, the ‘D’ is worth 2 points,
and the ‘E’ is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that “CODE” is worth 7 points.

In a file called scrabble.c in a folder called scrabble, 
implement a program in C that determines the winner of a short 
Scrabble-like game. Your program should prompt for input twice: 
once for “Player 1” to input their word and 
once for “Player 2” to input their word. 
Then, depending on which player scores the most points, your program should either 
print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!” (in the event the two players score equal points).
